# DoctorAppointmentBooking
The Online Doctor Appointment System is developed for the purpose of disallowing problems that are not present in the current system. Assumedly, this Doctor Appointment System will remove the hardships associated with the existing appointment system.
This project is just for self educational purposes. (Note :There is no backend attached to the project currently) .The project is just to test case the dsa that I have been learning .In the project I have used several dsa data types and techniques.

Here on the landing page there are three available cases : 
1. Doctor 
   First is for the doctors in case a new doctor wants to login or register. He/She can add their details or wants to check for appointments.
2. Patient
   In this the patient can see the available doctors with their professional details and their area of expertise and also which city they are present in. Here too there is a login and registration . Before login the registration is necessary so that searching techniques are applied.To give a feel of the authentication process.
3. Admin
   As the name signifies, this part is for the admin where admin can see the details of doctors and patients.
4. Exit 
   Lastly, we have the exit part to exit from the window.
